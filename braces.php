 * Write a function that takes a string and returns the index of the first
 * brace that breaks its balance (or returns the special value -1 if the string
 * is balanced). The first brace that breaks the balance is the brace closest
 * to the start of the string that isnâ€™t part of a balanced pair. Please state
 * any additional assumptions you make and try to make your function as
 * efficient as you can. For extra credit, write unit tests!
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * hello world		returns -1	Input is balanced
 * {}				returns -1	Input is balanced
 * {{{foo();}}}{}	returns -1	Input is balanced
 * {{}{}}			returns -1	Input is balanced
 * {{{}				returns 0	Brace at 0 has no close brace
 * }				returns 0	Brace at 0 has no open brace
 * {}{foo{}			returns 2	Brace at 2 has no close brace
